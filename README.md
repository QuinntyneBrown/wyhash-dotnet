[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yv41pshy1xaks5ps?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cocowalla/wyhash-dotnet)

Zero-allocation C# implementation of [Wang Yi's](https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash) 64-bit **wyhash** hash algorithm and **wyrand** PRNG.

wyhash is an extremely fast, portable hashing algorithm, and passes all of the [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher) tests (which evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash functions).

Getting Started
-----

Install the [WyHash](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WyHash) package from NuGet:

```powershell
Install-Package WyHash
```

WyHash implements [HashAlgorithm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.hashalgorithm?view=netframework-4.7.2), so can be integrated into existing projects easily:

```csharp
var seed = 42;
var hasher = WyHash64.Create(seed);

var result = hasher.ComputeHash(myData);
```

A common use case is getting the resulting hash as a 64-bit unsigned integer (`ulong`), so a static convenience method is also provided:

```csharp
// Note that if no seed is specified, it default to 0
var seed = 42;
var result = WyHash64.ComputeHash64(myData, seed);
```

The wyrand PRNG is also implemented:

```csharp
var rng = new WyRng(42);

// Generate pseudorandom values
ulong a64BitVal = rng.NextLong();
uint a32BitVal = rng.Next();

// Fill a buffer with pseudorandom bytes
var buffer = new byte[256];
rng.NextBytes(buffer);

// Span is also supported
Span<byte> spanBuffer = stackalloc byte[128];
rng.NextBytes(spanBuffer);
```

Performance & Future Work
-------------------------
At present (April 2019), wyhash is the fastest algorithm in the [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher) benchmark.

On a dev laptop with 64GB RAM and an Intel Xeon CPU E3-1545M v5 2.90GHz CPU, this implementation can process data at a rate of around 3.3GB/s, which is *very* fast.

Note that `PInvoke`ing into a native DLL built using the reference C code (see the `WyHash.Native` project) achieves around 10.8GB/s, so there is still work to do to bridge the performance gap.

The bottleneck is **64-bit integer multiplication**, as .NET doesn't yet support intrinsics, which would allow performing 64x64 multiplication in a single instruction on supported platforms. Work on this is ongoing by the .NET team, and is expected to land in .NET Core 3.0 - support is unlikely to make it into the .NET Framework though. I expected that using instructions such as BMI2 `MULX` or SSE4.1 `PMULLD` will get this implementation running at roughly the same speeds as the C reference code (that is, more or less *RAM SPEED*)

Latest benchmarks (`DataSize` is the size of data hashed, in bytes):
